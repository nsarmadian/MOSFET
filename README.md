# MOSFET
ongoing work! linear regression, XGBoost and NN models on MOSFET
In this dataset, the I-V data of a long channel MOSFET is collected from a circuit simulator, 
and data is divided into training (with test) and validation data (these are not present in the training dataset).
Drain current (Id) is recorded for different values of drain-source voltage (VDS) and gate-source voltage (VDS).
Gate length of 1um, VT0=0.3V with CLM coefficient=0.001 is considered while collecting data.
Notebook associated with this data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/subirmaity/mos-nn-v1
